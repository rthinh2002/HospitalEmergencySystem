# HospitalEmergencySystem
This is the first console Java project that I create, using the University of Adelaide existed assignment, together with my own implementation
This is a program, represent the emergency hotline of a Hospital. The program include 5 options, which are adding the patient to the list according to the triage level. Next is assign ambulance for the first patient in the list. After that is print the patient list. Fourth option is check the position of the patient in the waiting list by ID. Finally is assign ambulance for patient by ID
For this project, I created my own class that simulate the process of LIFO of Stack data structure
